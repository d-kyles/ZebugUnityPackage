     |  --- ZebugPreferences
     |      The settings for which channel is enabled will need to persist into builds, so
     |      PlayerPrefs won't do the trick.
     |
     |      Currently this file isn't used, and channels with important production diagnostic info
     |      can default to being on in builds by calling the follwing in their constructor:
     |          `if (!Application.isEditor) { SetEnabled(true) }`
     |
     |      Ideally you want to make sure your version control system ignores this file, as your
     |      preferred debug channels will likely be different than theirs.
     |
     |      --- TODO(dan): Figure out a good way to do defaults for a CI that can be overridden by
     |                     the local user.
     |      --- TODO(dan): It would also be good to be able to easily specify what will be editor
     |                     vs what will be set in a build. Using this one file like this will result
     |                     in editor settings persisting into the build by default
